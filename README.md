Data Migration from Azure  storage to Bigquery


## 1. Storage Transfer Service ( STS) 
Storage Transfer Service enables you to quickly and securely transfer data to, from, and between object and file storage systems, including Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Azure Storage, on-premises data, and more. Depending on your source type, you can easily create and run Google-managed transfers or configure self-hosted transfers that give you full control over network routing and bandwidth usage. It makes it easy to perform large-scale online data transfers to migrate data to GCP, archive cold data to GCS, replicate data for business continuity, or transfer data for analytics and machine learning in the cloud.


## 2. Dataproc ( Spark Serverless Batch Jobs) 

Dataproc is a managed Spark and Hadoop service that lets you take advantage of open source data tools for batch processing, querying, streaming, and machine learning. Dataproc automation helps you create clusters quickly, manage them easily, and save money by turning clusters off when you don't need them. With less time and money spent on administration, you can focus on your jobs and your data.
